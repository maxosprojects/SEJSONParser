# Space Engineers JSON Parser

## Description
This is just a small JSON library which can be used for de-/serialization in Space Engineers' ingame scripts in a performance friendly way.

## Setup
If you want to use this in Visual Studio with SE-MDK (Highly Recommended), just add the JSONParser project to your Solution, add a reference to it to your ingame script project, and you're set.
In this repository you'll find an example setup which will get you going.

Otherwise, you can of course find the JSON Parser on my Steam workshop (the library will be minified).
